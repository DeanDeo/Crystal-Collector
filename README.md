# Crystal Collector

This project uses javascript/jquery functions to build a crystal counter game.

When the game begins, a random number is generated by the computer.

4 random numbers are generated for each crystal.

The object of the game is to match the number generated by the computer 
by adding (clicking) the crystals.

If the user is able to add correctly and match the number, they win.

If the user adds higher than that number, it is counted as a loss.

Wins and losses are displayed on the screen.

If you would like to try this yourself I always recomment starting with getting
the HTML on the screen and then moving to your javascript/jquery.
